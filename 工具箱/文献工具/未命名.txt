- **Freight forwarder**. An individual or company that accepts less-than-truckload (TLT) or less-than-carload (LCL) shipments from shippers and combines them into carload or truckload lots. Carriers collecting small shipments to be cumulatively consolidated and transported relying upon a single or several modes of transportation to a given destination. Functions performed by a freight forwarder may include receiving small shipments (e.g., less than container load) from consignors, consolidating them into larger lots, contracts with carriers for transport between ports of embarkation and debarkation, conduct documentation transactions, and arrange delivery of shipments to the consignees.
- **Freight village**. A concentration (or a cluster) of freight-related activities within a specific area, commonly built for such a purpose, master-planned and managed. These activities include distribution centers, warehouses and storage areas, transport terminals, offices and other facilities supporting those activities, such as public utilities, parking space, and even hotels and restaurants. Although a freight village can be serviced by a single-mode, intermodal facilities can offer direct access to global and regional markets.
- **Fringe parking**. An area for parking usually located outside the Central Business District (CBD) and most often used by suburban residents who work or shop downtown. Commonly corresponds to an access point of a transit system, such as a rail or subway station.
- **Fuel Cell**. A device that produces electrical energy directly from the controlled electrochemical oxidation of the fuel, commonly hydrogen. It does not contain an intermediate heat cycle, as do most other electrical generation techniques.
- **Gasohol**. A blend of motor gasoline (leaded or unleaded) and alcohol (generally ethanol but sometimes methanol) limited to 10 percent by volume of alcohol. Gasohol is included in finished leaded and unleaded motor gasoline.
- **Gasoline**. A complex mixture of relatively volatile hydrocarbons, with or without small quantities of additives, obtained by blending appropriate refinery streams to form a fuel suitable for use in spark-ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes both leaded or unleaded grades of finished motor gasoline, blending components, and gasohol.
- **Gateway**. A location offering accessibility to a large system of circulation of freight, passengers and/or information. Gateways reap the advantage of a favorable physical location such as highway junctions, the confluence of rivers, seaboards, and have been the object of a significant accumulation of transport infrastructures such as terminals and their links. A gateway generally commands the entrance to and the exit from its catchment area. In other words, it is a pivotal point for the entrance and the exit of merchandise in a region, a country, or a continent. Gateways tend to be locations where intermodal transfers are performed.
- **General cargo**. General cargo consists of those products or commodities such as timber, structural steel, rolled newsprint, concrete forms, agricultural equipment that are not conducive to packaging or unitization. Break-bulk cargo (e.g., packaged products such as lubricants and cereal) are often regarded as a subdivision of general cargo.

The great circle route follows the sphericity of the globe, any shortest route is the one following the curve of the planet, along the parallels.
- **Green logistics**. Supply chain management practices and strategies that reduce the environmental and energy footprint of freight distribution. They focus on material handling, waste management, packaging, and transport.
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**. A measure of the total value of goods and services produced by a domestic economy during a given period, usually one year. Obtained by adding the value contributed by each sector of the economy in the form of profits, compensation to employees, and depreciation (consumption of capital).

- **Haulage, Carrier / Merchant**. Carrier haulage is an inland container movement (to or from a port terminal) done by the ocean shipping company, often through a parent company. The carrier is liable if the merchandise is lost or damaged during transport, or if there is a delay. Merchant haulage is when the importer or the exporter assumes the transport of the container to or from a port terminal. The merchant is liable if the cargo is lost or damaged. One of the main advantages of merchant haulage is that it gives importers and exporters more flexibility in the timing of inland distribution, However, the merchant must pick and bring back the container at a predesigned location and time.
- **Headway**. The time interval between vehicles moving in the same direction on a particular route.
- **Heavy rail**. An electric railway of high capacity and characterized by exclusive rights-of-way, multi-car trains, high speed and rapid acceleration, sophisticated signaling, and high platform loading.

- **Inland port**. A rail or a barge terminal that is linked to a maritime terminal with regular inland transport services. An inland port has a level of integration with the maritime terminal and supports more efficient access to the inland market both for inbound and outbound traffic. This implies an array of related logistical activities linked with the terminal, such as distribution centers, depots for containers and chassis, warehouses and logistical service providers.
- **Integrated carriers**. Carriers that have both air and ground fleets; or other combinations, such as sea, rail, and truck. Since they usually handle large volumes, they are less expensive and offer more diverse services than regular carriers.
- **Intermediacy**. Focus on the terminal as an intermediate point in the flows of passengers or freight. This term is applied to the frequent occurrence of places gaining an advantage because they are between other places. The ability to exploit transshipment has been an important feature of many terminals.
- **Intermodal terminal**. A terminal that can accommodate several modes of transportation. They increasingly tend to be specializing at handling specific types of passengers or freight traffic, while they may share the same infrastructures.
- **Intermodal transport**. The movement of passengers or freight from an origin to a destination relying on several modes of transportation. Each carrier is issuing its own ticket (passengers) or contract (freight). The movements from one mode of transport to another are commonly taking place at a terminal specifically designed for such a purpose. Therefore, intermodal transportation in the literal sense refers to an exchange of passengers or freight between two transportation modes, but the term has become more commonly used for freight and container transportation across a sequence of modes. In North America, the term intermodal is also used to refer to containerized rail transportation.
- **Intermodalism**. A system of transport whereby two or more modes of transport are used to transport the same loading unit or truck in an integrated manner, without loading or unloading, in a transport chain. Typically used in three contexts: 1) most narrowly, it refers to containerization, piggyback service, or other technologies that provide the seamless movement of goods and people by more than one mode of transport. 2) more broadly, intermodalism refers to the provision of connections between different modes, such as adequate highways to ports or bus feeder services to rail transit. 3) In its broadest interpretation, intermodalism refers to a holistic view of transportation in which individual modes work together or within their own niches to provide the user with the best choices of service, and in which the consequences on all modes of policies for a single-mode are considered. This view has been called balanced, integrated, or comprehensive transportation in the past.
- **International Air Transportation Association (IATA)**. Established in 1945, a trade association serving airlines, passengers, shippers, travel agents, and governments.

Over repeated choice occasions preferences are assumed to have a probabilistic component. For the logit model, this random component of preference is taken to have a double exponential distribution.
- **Lowry model**. One of the first transportation/land use model to be designed in 1964. The core assumption is that regional and urban growth (or decline) is a function of the expansion (or contraction) of the basic sector.

Declining marginal utility implies that each additional unit produced or consumed involves less derived utility than the previous one. This is common in retailing where a consumer derives lower benefits from owning more of the same good. Increasing marginal utility implies that each additional unit produced or consumed involves more derived utility than the previous one. This is common in manufacturing where the principle of economies of scale underlines that each additional produced unit comes with a higher utility (profit) for the producer.

The term offshore can be misleading as many ports performing this function are located at standard port locations.
- **Operating cost**. Costs that vary with the quantity shipped in the short-run. 1) Fixed operating cost refers to expenditures that are independent of the amount of use. For a car, it would involve costs such as insurance costs, fees for license and registration, depreciation and finance charges; 2) Variable operating cost: expenditures which are dependent on the amount of use. For a car, it would involve costs such as the cost of gasoline, oil, tires, and other maintenance.
